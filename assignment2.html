    <h1>Current Economy</h1><br><br>
    <p class="p1">
    	The economy of India is characterised as a developing market economy.[42][43] It is the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). According to the IMF, on a per capita income basis, India ranked 142nd by GDP (nominal) and 119th by GDP (PPP) in 2018.[44] From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments promoted protectionist economic policies with extensive state intervention and regulation; the end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad program of economic liberalisation.[45][46] Since the start of the 21st century, annual average GDP growth has been 6% to 7%,[43] and from 2014 to 2018, India was the world's fastest growing major economy, surpassing China.[47][48] Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century.

    <p class="p2">
    	The long-term growth perspective of the Indian economy remains positive due to its young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment rates, and is increasing integration into the global economy.[9] The economy slowed in 2017, due to shocks of "demonetisation" in 2016 and introduction of Goods and Services Tax in 2017
